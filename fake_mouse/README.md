# Fake mouse

This turns TOMU into a kind a fake mouse which keeps the host computer awake by moving the mouse every second.
The mouse movement is minimum and immediatly cancelled by a second move in the opposite direction. 
It is generally not percievable by the user, so you can keep it while actively using your computer.
